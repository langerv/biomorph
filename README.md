# biomorph
A little game to test ideas about metamorphosis and RPG

## Installation

1. Install Arcade:
```
pip3 install arcade==2.1.3
```

2. Clone this repo then launch the game, that's it!
```
python game.py
```

3. (Optional) To run aptitude_unittest.py please install additional packages:

## How to play?
You (the little circle at the center of the scene) are a biomorph: you can use the mouse and click somewhere or on something to move.
You are surrounded by colorful shapes representing other creatures.
Once you click on a shape, you can morph by soaking up its characteristics (like color and size). 
Ecah creature including you has aptitudes like in RPG games. 
Watch out, some of them are physical and others are psychical, and they evolve differently.

The game includes 3 levels demonstrating different use cases:
